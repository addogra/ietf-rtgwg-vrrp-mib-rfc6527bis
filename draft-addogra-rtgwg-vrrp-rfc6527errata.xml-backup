   This specification defines a portion of the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with network management based on the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  In particular, it defines
   objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling routers that
   employ the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Version 3 (VRRPv3) for
   both IPv4 and IPv6 as defined in RFC 5798.  This memo obsoletes RFC
   2787.</t>

      <t>
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"/>, STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579"/> and STD 58, RFC 2580

   this document reflect changes in the VRRP protocol between RFC 2338

      <t>
   Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more
   interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables defined in
   the VRRP MIB.  This MIB module imports ifIndex from the IF-MIB.  At
   this time, the latest version of the IF-MIB is from RFC 2863

   This MIB module is designed to support multi-stack implementations

   Identifier (VRID), and ifIndex are used to uniquely identify rows in
   a multi-stack implementation.</t>

   During the review of this document, it emerged that there are
   different possible interpretations of <xref target="RFC5798"/>.  The authors of that
   document and the VRRP working group were unable to reach consensus as
   to which interpretation is correct.  This document makes the
   following assumption:</t>
      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="3">
        <dt/>
        <dd>
      IPv4 and IPv6 virtual routers are treated as two separate logical
      entities and represented as two separate entries in the
      vrrpv3OperationsTable.  This is required due to the undefined
      behavior of the protocol in <xref target="RFC5798"/> in a multi-stack scenario.</dd>

   The following figure shows a hypothetical network with two VRRP
   routers, VR1 &amp; VR2, configured with two virtual routers.  Addresses
   in '()' indicate the address of the default gateway for a given host;
   H1 to H4 are IPv4 hosts, and H5 to H8 are IPv6 hosts.  A, B, and C
   are IPv4 addresses, and X, Y, and Z are IPv6 addresses.  In the
   diagram, "Interface" is used in the context defined in IF-MIB.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>
      <t>
   The objects vrrpv3OperationsPriority, vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr,
   vrrpv3OperationsAdvInterval, vrrpv3OperationsPreemptMode,
   vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode, vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus, and
   vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrRowStatus possess the read-create attribute.
   Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the operation
   of a virtual router.</t>
      <t>
   Examples of how these objects could adversely affect the operation of
   a virtual router include:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>An unauthorized change to vrrpv3OperationsPriority can affect the
     priority used in active election, resulting in this router either
     becoming active when it should not, or in some other router being
     elected by preference.  While this will disrupt the operator's
     plans, it will only replicate the unfortunate failure of multiple
     routers, and any router that does become active will be capable of
     filling that role.</li>
        <li>Modification of vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr would cause the
     configured router to take on an incorrect IP address if it becomes
     active, which would be potentially very disruptive to the network
     operation.</li>
        <li>A malicious change to vrrpv3OperationsAdvInterval could either
     result in the configured router flooding the network with
     advertisements when it becomes active, or the new active not
     advertising frequently enough such that some routers do not learn
     about the new active.</li>
        <li>vrrpv3OperationsPreemptMode controls whether this router will
     preempt another active router.  Setting it inappropriately will at
     worse cause one router to be active against the operator's plans,
     but that router will still be qualified to operate as a active.</li>
        <li>Setting the vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode could prevent an
     IPv6-capable VRRP router from accepting packets addressed to the
     address owner's IPv6 address as its own even if it is not the IPv6
     address owner.  Although the default for this object is false(2),
     unauthorized setting of this object to false might restrict the
     function of some parts of the network.</li>
        <li>The vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus object that could be used to disable
     a virtual router.  While there are other columns that, if changed,
     could disrupt operations, they cannot be changed without first
     changing the RowStatus object.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.</t>
      <t>
   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"/>), including full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   <xref target="RFC3414"/> with the AES cipher algorithm <xref target="RFC3826"/>.  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   <xref target="RFC5591"/> in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   <xref target="RFC5592"/> or TLS/DTLS <xref target="RFC6353"/>.</t>
      <t>
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>

	<abstract>
	  <t>
	    This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for
	    IPv4 and IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol, and it is
	    based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and in
	    "Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6".  VRRP specifies an
	    election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a
	    virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router
	    controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a virtual
	    router is called the Active router, and it forwards packets sent to these
	    IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  VRRP Active routers are configured with
	    virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and VRRP Backup routers infer the
	    address family of the virtual addresses being carried based on the
	    transport protocol.  Within a VRRP router, the virtual routers in
	    each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are a domain unto
	    themselves and do not overlap.  The election process provides dynamic
	    failover in the forwarding responsibility should the Active become
	    unavailable.  For IPv4, the advantage gained from using VRRP is a
	    higher-availability default path without requiring configuration of
	    dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.  For
	    IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker
	    switchover to Backup routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6
	    Neighbor Discovery mechanisms.</t>

<name>Operation over FDDI, Token Ring, and ATM LANE</name>
<section anchor="sect-a.1">
<name>Operation over FDDI</name>
<t>
  FDDI interfaces remove from the FDDI ring frames that have a source
  MAC address matching the device's hardware address.  Under some
  conditions, such as router isolations, ring failures, protocol
  transitions, etc., VRRP may cause there to be more than one Active
  router.  If a Active router installs the virtual router MAC address
  as the hardware address on a FDDI device, then other Actives'
  ADVERTISEMENTS will be removed from the ring during the Active
convergence, and convergence will fail.</t>
<t>
  To avoid this, an implementation SHOULD configure the virtual router
  MAC address by adding a unicast MAC filter in the FDDI device, rather
  than changing its hardware MAC address.  This will prevent a Active
router from removing any ADVERTISEMENTS it did not originate.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="sect-a.2">
  <name>Operation over Token Ring</name>
  <t>
    Token Ring has several characteristics that make running VRRP
  difficult.  These include the following:</t>
  <ul spacing="normal">
    <li>In order to switch to a new Active located on a different bridge
    Token-Ring segment from the previous Active when using source-
    route bridges, a mechanism is required to update cached source-
    route information.</li>
    <li>No general multicast mechanism is supported across old and new
    Token-Ring adapter implementations.  While many newer Token-Ring
    adapters support group addresses, Token-Ring functional-address
    support is the only generally available multicast mechanism.  Due
    to the limited number of Token-Ring functional addresses, these
    may collide with other usage of the same Token-Ring functional
    addresses.</li>
  </ul>
  <t>
    Due to these difficulties, the preferred mode of operation over Token
    Ring will be to use a Token-Ring functional address for the VRID
    virtual MAC address.  Token-Ring functional addresses have the two
    high-order bits in the first MAC address octet set to B'1'.  They
    range from 03-00-00-00-00-80 to 03-00-02-00-00-00 (canonical format).
    However, unlike multicast addresses, there is only one unique
    functional address per bit position.  The functional addresses
    03-00-00-10-00-00 through 03-00-02-00-00-00 are reserved by the
    Token-Ring Architecture <xref target="TKARCH"/> for user-defined applications.
    However, since there are only 12 user-defined Token-Ring functional
    addresses, there may be other non-IPvX protocols using the same
    functional address.  Since the Novell IPX <xref target="IPX"/> protocol uses the
    03-00-00-10-00-00 functional address, operation of VRRP over Token
    Ring will avoid use of this functional address.  In general, Token-
    Ring VRRP users will be responsible for resolution of other user-
  defined Token-Ring functional address conflicts.</t>
  <t>
    VRIDs are mapped directly to Token-Ring functional addresses.  In
    order to decrease the likelihood of functional-address conflicts,
    allocation will begin with the largest functional address.  Most non-
    IPvX protocols use the first or first couple user-defined functional
    addresses, and it is expected that VRRP users will choose VRIDs
  sequentially, starting with 1.</t>

  <t>
    Or, more succinctly, octets 3 and 4 of the functional address are
  equal to (0x4000 >> (VRID - 1)) in non-canonical format.</t>
  <t>
    Since a functional address cannot be used as a MAC-level source
    address, the real MAC address is used as the MAC source address in
    VRRP advertisements.  This is not a problem for bridges, since
    packets addressed to functional addresses will be sent on the
  spanning-tree explorer path <xref target="ISO.10038.1993"/>.</t>
  <t>
    The functional-address mode of operation MUST be implemented by
  routers supporting VRRP on Token Ring.</t>
  <t>
    Additionally, routers MAY support the unicast mode of operation to
    take advantage of newer Token-Ring adapter implementations that
    support non-promiscuous reception for multiple unicast MAC addresses
    and to avoid both the multicast traffic and usage conflicts
    associated with the use of Token-Ring functional addresses.  Unicast
    mode uses the same mapping of VRIDs to virtual MAC addresses as
    Ethernet.  However, one important difference exists.  ND
    request/reply packets contain the virtual MAC address as the source
    MAC address.  The reason for this is that some Token-Ring driver
    implementations keep a cache of MAC address/source-routing
  information independent of the ND cache.</t>
  <t>
    Hence, these implementations have to receive a packet with the
    virtual MAC address as the source address in order to transmit to
  that MAC address in a source-route-bridged network.</t>
  <t>
    Unicast mode on Token Ring has one limitation that should be
    considered.  If there are VRID routers on different source-route-
    bridge segments, and there are host implementations that keep their
    source-route information in the ND cache and do not listen to
    gratuitous NDs, these hosts will not update their ND source-route
    information correctly when a switchover occurs.  The only possible
    solution is to put all routers with the same VRID on the same source-
    route-bridge segment and use techniques to prevent that bridge
    segment from being a single point of failure.  These techniques are
  beyond the scope of this document.</t>
  <t>
    For both the multicast and unicast mode of operation, VRRP
    advertisements sent to 224.0.0.18 should be encapsulated as described
  in <xref target="RFC1469"/>.</t>
