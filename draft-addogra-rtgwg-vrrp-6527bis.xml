        This document defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for
        IPv4 and IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol, and it is
        based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and in
        "Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6".  VRRP specifies an
        election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a
        virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router
        controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a virtual
        router is called the VRRP Active Router, and it forwards packets sent to these
        IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  VRRP Active Routers are configured with
        virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and VRRP Backup Routers infer the
        address family of the virtual addresses being advertised based on the
        IP protocol version.  Within a VRRP router, the virtual routers in
        each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are a domain unto
        themselves and do not overlap.  The election process provides dynamic
        failover in the forwarding responsibility should the Active Router become
        unavailable.  For IPv4, the advantage gained from using VRRP is a
        higher-availability default path without requiring configuration of
        dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.  For
        IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker
        switchover to Backup Routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6
        Neighbor Discovery mechanisms.

        <name>A Note on Terminology</name>
        <t>
	  This document discusses both IPv4 and IPv6 operations, and with
          respect to the VRRP protocol, many of the descriptions and procedures
          are common.  In this document, it would be less verbose to be able to
          refer to "IP" to mean either "IPv4 or IPv6".  However, historically,
          the term "IP" usually refers to IPv4.  For this reason, in this
          specification, the term "IPvX" (where X is 4 or 6) is introduced to
          mean either "IPv4" or "IPv6".  In this text, where the IP version
          matters, the appropriate term is used and the use of the term "IP" is
          avoided.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-1.3">
        <name>IPv4</name>
        <t>
	  There are a number of methods that an IPv4 end-host can use to
          determine its first-hop router for a particular IPv4 destination.
          These include running (or snooping) a dynamic routing protocol such
          as Routing Information Protocol (RIP) <xref target="RFC2453"/> or OSPF version 2
	  <xref target="RFC2328"/>, running an ICMP router discovery client
        <xref target="RFC1256"/>, or using a statically configured default route.</t>
        <t>
	  Running a dynamic routing protocol on every end-host may be
          infeasible for a number of reasons, including administrative
          overhead, processing overhead, security issues, or the lack of an
          implementation for a particular platform.  Neighbor or router discovery
          protocols may require active participation by all hosts on a network,
          requiring large timer values to reduce protocol overhead associated
          with the associated protocol packets processing for each host.  This can result in
          a significant delay in the detection of an unreachable router and,
          such a delay may introduce unacceptably long periods of unreachability for the
          default route.
        </t>
        <t>
	  The use of a statically configured default route is quite popular since it
          minimizes configuration and processing overhead on the end-host and
          is supported by virtually every IPv4 implementation.  This mode of
          operation is likely to persist as dynamic host configuration
          protocols <xref target="RFC2131"/> are deployed, which typically provide
          configuration for an end-host IPv4 address and default gateway.
          However, this creates a single point of failure.  Loss of the default
          router results in a catastrophic event, isolating all end-hosts that
        are unable to detect an available alternate path.</t>
        <t>
	  The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is designed to
          eliminate the single point of failure inherent in an network utilizing
          static default routing.  VRRP specifies an election protocol that
          dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the
          VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router controlling the IPv4
          address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Active Router and
          forwards packets sent to these IPv4 addresses.  The election process
          provides dynamic failover in the forwarding responsibility should the
          Active Router become unavailable.  Any of the virtual router's IPv4
          addresses on a LAN can then be used as the default first hop
	  router by end-hosts.  The advantage gained from using VRRP is a
          higher availability default path without requiring configuration of
        dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-1.4">
        <name>IPv6</name>
        <t>
	  IPv6 hosts on a LAN will usually learn about one or more default
          routers by receiving Router Advertisements sent using the IPv6
          Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol <xref target="RFC4861"/>.  The Router
          Advertisements are multicast periodically at a rate at which the hosts
          will learn about the default routers in a few minutes.  They are not
          sent frequently enough to rely on the absence of the Router
        Advertisement to detect router failures.</t>
        <t>
	  Neighbor Discovery (ND) includes a mechanism called Neighbor
          Unreachability Detection to detect the failure of a neighbor node
          (router or host) or the forwarding path to a neighbor.  This is done
          by sending unicast ND Neighbor Solicitation messages to the neighbor
          node.  To reduce the overhead of sending Neighbor Solicitations, they
          are only sent to neighbors to which the node is actively sending
          traffic and only after there has been no positive indication that the
          router is up for a period of time.  Using the default parameters in
          ND, it will take a host about 38 seconds to learn that a router is
          unreachable before it will switch to another default router.  This
          delay would be very noticeable to users and cause some transport
        protocol implementations to time out.</t>
        <t>
	  While the ND unreachability detection could be made quicker by
          changing the parameters to be more aggressive (note that the current
          lower limit for this is 5 seconds), this would have the downside of
          significantly increasing the overhead of ND traffic, especially when
          there are many hosts all trying to determine the reachability of one
        or more routers.</t>
        <t>
	  The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6 provides a much
          faster switchover to an alternate default router than can be obtained
          using standard ND procedures.  Using VRRP, a Backup Router can take
          over for a failed default router in around three seconds (using VRRP
          default parameters).  This is done without any interaction with the
        hosts and a minimum amount of VRRP traffic.</t>

	  Backup of an IPvX address or addresses is the primary function of

	<t>
	  A simple model of Active Router election among a set of redundant routers is
          to treat each router with equal preference and claim victory after
          converging to any router as Active Router.  However, there are likely to be
          many environments where there is a distinct preference (or range of
          preferences) among the set of redundant routers.  For example, this
          preference may be based upon access link cost or speed, router
          performance or reliability, or other policy considerations.  The
          protocol should allow the expression of this relative path preference
          in an intuitive manner and guarantee Active Router convergence to the most
          preferential router currently available.

	<name>Minimization of Unnecessary Service Disruptions</name>
	<t>
	  Once Active Router election has been performed, any unnecessary transitions
          between Active and Backup Routers can result in a disruption in
          service.  The protocol should ensure that, after Active Router election, no
          state transition is triggered by any Backup Router of equal or lower
          preference as long as the Active Router continues to function properly.
        </t>
	<t>
	  Some environments may find it beneficial to avoid the state
          transition triggered when a router that is preferred over the current
          Active Router becomes available.  It may be useful to support an override of
          the immediate restoration to the preferred path.

	<name>Efficient Operation over Extended LANs</name>
	<t>
	  Sending IPvX packets, i.e., sending either IPv4 or IPv6, on a
          multiaccess LAN requires mapping from an IPvX address to a MAC
          address.  The use of the virtual router MAC address in an extended
          LAN employing learning bridges can have a significant effect on the
          bandwidth overhead of packets sent to the virtual router.  If the
          virtual router MAC address is never used as the source address in a
          link-level frame, then the MAC address location is never learned,
          resulting in flooding of all packets sent to the virtual router.  To
          improve the efficiency in this environment, the protocol should do the
          following:

        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">

	  Sub-second detection of Active Router failure is needed in both

	  One possible problematic scenario when using small
          VRRP_Advertisement_Intervals may occur when a router is generating
          more packets on a LAN than it can transmit, and a queue
          builds up on the router.  When this occurs, it is possible that packets being
          transmitted onto the VRRP-protected LAN could see larger queueing
          delay than the smallest VRRP Advertisement_Interval.  In this case,
          the Active_Down_Interval may be small enough that normal queuing
          delays might cause a Backup Router to conclude that the Active Router is down,
          and, hence, promote itself to Active Router.  Very shortly afterwards, the
          delayed VRRP packets from the Active Router cause a switch back to Backup
          Router.  Furthermore, this process can repeat many times per second,
          causing significant disruption to traffic.  To mitigate this problem,
          priority forwarding of VRRP packets should be considered.  The Active
          Router SHOULD observe that this situation is occurring and log the problem.

      <name>VRRP Overview</name>
      <t>
	VRRP specifies an election protocol to provide the virtual router
        function described earlier.  All protocol messaging is performed
        using either IPv4 or IPv6 multicast datagrams. Thus, the protocol can
        operate over a variety of multiaccess LAN technologies supporting
        IPvX multicast.  Each link of a VRRP virtual router has a single
        well-known MAC address allocated to it.  This document currently only
        details the mapping to networks using an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC
        address.  The virtual router MAC address is used as the source in all
        periodic VRRP messages sent by the Active Router to enable MAC
      learning by layer-2 bridges in an extended LAN.</t>
      <t>
	A virtual router is defined by its virtual router identifier (VRID)
        and a set of either IPv4 or IPv6 address(es).  A VRRP router may
        associate a virtual router with its real address on an interface.
        The scope of each virtual router is restricted to a single LAN.  A
        VRRP router may be configured with additional virtual router mappings
        and priority for virtual routers it is willing to back up.  The
        mapping between the VRID and its IPvX address(es) must be coordinated
        among all VRRP routers on a LAN.
      </t>
      <t>
	There is no restriction against reusing a VRID with a different
        address mapping on different LANs, nor is there a restriction against
        using the same VRID number for a set of IPv4 addresses and a set of
        IPv6 addresses. However, these are two different virtual routers.
      </t>
      <t>
	To minimize network traffic, only the Active Router for each virtual router
        sends periodic VRRP Advertisement messages.  A Backup Router will not
        attempt to preempt the Active Router unless it has a higher priority.  This
        eliminates service disruption unless a more preferred path becomes
        available.  It's also possible to administratively prohibit Active Router
        preemption attempts.  The only exception is that a VRRP router will
        always become the Active Router for any virtual router associated with
        address(es) it owns.  If the Active Router becomes unavailable, then the highest-
        priority Backup Router will transition to Active Router after a short delay,
        providing a controlled transition of virtual router
        responsibility with minimal service interruption.
      </t>
      <t>
	The VRRP protocol design provides rapid transition from Backup to
        Active Router to minimize service interruption and incorporates
        optimizations that reduce protocol complexity while guaranteeing
        controlled Active Router transition for typical operational scenarios.  These
        optimizations result in an election protocol with minimal runtime
        state requirements, minimal active protocol states, and a single
        message type and sender.  The typical operational scenarios are
        defined to be two redundant routers and/or distinct path preferences
        for each router.  A side effect when these assumptions are violated,
        i.e., more than two redundant paths with equal preference, is
        that duplicate packets may be forwarded for a brief period during
        Active Router election.  However, the typical scenario assumptions are
        likely to cover the vast majority of deployments, loss of the Active
        Router is infrequent, and the expected duration for Active Router election
        convergence is quite small (&lt; 1 second ).  Thus, the VRRP optimizations
        represent significant simplifications in the protocol design while incurring
      an insignificant probability of brief network disruption.</t>

                 ]]></artwork>
        <t>
          In the IPv4 case, i.e., IPvX is IPv4 everywhere in the figure,
          each router is permanently assigned an IPv4 address on the LAN
          interface (Router-1 is assigned IPv4 A and Router-2 is assigned IPv4 B), and
          each host installs a static default route through one of the routers
          (in this example, they all use Router-1's IPv4 A).
        </t>
        <t>
          In the IPv6 case, i.e., IPvX is IPv6 everywhere in the figure, each router has its own
          Link-Local IPv6 address on the LAN interface for the VRRP protocol and a link-local
          IPv6 address per VRID that is shared with the other routers that serve the same VRID.
          Each host learns a default route from Router
          Advertisements through one of the routers (in this example, they all
        use Router-1's IPv6 Link-Local A).</t>
        <t>
          In an IPv4 VRRP environment, each router supports reception and transmission for
          the exact same IPv4 address.  Router-1 is said to be the IPv4
          address owner of IPv4 A, and Router-2 is the IPv4 address owner of
          IPv4 B.  A virtual router is then defined by associating a unique
          identifier (the virtual router ID) with the address owned by a
          router.
        </t>
        <t>
          In an IPv6 VRRP environment, each router supports reception and transmission with
          the exact same Link-Local IPv6 address.
          In an IPv6 VRRP environment, each router will support transmission and
          reception for the Link-Local IPv6 addresses associated with both VRIDs.
          Router-1 is said to be the IPv6 address owner
          of IPv6 A, and Router-2 is the IPv6 address owner of IPv6 B.  A virtual
          router is then defined by associating a unique identifier (the
          virtual router ID) with the address owned by a router.
        </t>
        <t>
          Finally, in both the IPv4 and IPv6 cases, the VRRP protocol manages
          virtual router failover to a Backup Router.
        </t>
        <t>
          The IPv4 example above shows a virtual router configured to cover the
          IPv4 address owned by Router-1 (VRID=1, IPv4_Address=A).  When VRRP is
          enabled on Router-1 for VRID=1, it will assert itself as Active Router, with
          priority = 255, since it is the IP address owner for the virtual
          router IP address.  When VRRP is enabled on Router-2 for VRID=1, it will
          transition to Backup Router, with priority = 100 (the default priority is
          100), since it is not the IPv4 address owner.  If Router-1 should fail,
          then the VRRP protocol will transition Router-2 to Active Router, temporarily
          taking over forwarding responsibility for IPv4 A to provide
          uninterrupted service to the hosts.  When Router-1 returns to service, it
        will re-assert itself as Active Router.</t>
        <t>
          The IPv6 example above shows a virtual router configured to cover the
          IPv6 address owned by Router-1 (VRID=1, IPv6_Address=A).  When VRRP is
          enabled on Router-1 for VRID=1, it will assert itself as Active Router, with
          priority = 255, since it is the IPv6 address owner for the virtual
          router IPv6 address.  When VRRP is enabled on Router-2 for VRID=1, it
          will transition to Backup Router, with priority = 100 (the default priority
          is 100), since it is not the IPv6 address owner.  If Router-1 should
          fail, then the VRRP protocol will transition Router-2 to Active Router,
          temporarily taking over forwarding responsibility for IPv6 A to
          provide uninterrupted service to the IPv6 hosts.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that in both cases in this example, IPvX B is not backed up and it
          is only used by Router-2 as its interface address.  In order to back up
          IPvX B, a second virtual router must be configured.  This is shown in
        the next section.</t>

	  <t>
	    The priority field specifies the sending VRRP router's priority for
            the virtual router.  Higher values equal higher priority.  This field
            is an 8-bit unsigned integer field.
          </t>
	  <t>
	    The priority value for the VRRP router that owns the IPvX address
            associated with the virtual router MUST be 255 (decimal).
          </t>
	  <t>
	    VRRP routers backing up a virtual router MUST use priority values
            between 1-254 (decimal).  The default priority value for VRRP routers
            backing up a virtual router is 100 (decimal).
          </t>
	  <t>
	    The priority value zero (0) has special meaning, indicating that the
            current Active Router has stopped participating in VRRP.  This is used to
            trigger Backup Routers to quickly transition to Active Router without having
            to wait for the current Active Router to time out.

	  <name>Maximum Advertisement Interval (Max Adver Int)</name>
	  <t>
	    The Maximum Advertisement Interval is a 12-bit field that indicates
            the time interval (in centiseconds) between ADVERTISEMENTS.  The
            default is 100 centiseconds (1 second).
          </t>
	  <t>
	    Note that higher-priority Active Routers with slower transmission
            rates than their Backup Routers are unstable.  This is because
            lower-priority nodes configured to faster rates could come online and
            decide they should be Active Routers before they have heard anything from
            the higher-priority Active Router with a slower rate.  When this happens, it
            is temporary: once the lower-priority node does hear from the higher-priority
            Active Router, it will relinquish Active Router status.

	    The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement
            sum of the entire VRRP message starting with the version field and a
            "pseudo-header" as defined in Section 8.1 of <xref target="RFC2460"/>.  The next

            A priority value of 255 designates a particular router as the "IPvX address owner".

            router on the link in this way for a single VRID.
          </t>
          <t>
            Routers with priority 255 will, as soon as they start up, preempt all
            lower-priority routers.  No more than one router on the link is to be
            configured with priority 255, especially if preemption is set.  If no
            router has this priority, and preemption is disabled, then no
            preemption will occur.

          <t>
            When there are multiple Backup Routers, their priority values should
            be uniformly distributed.  For example, if one Backup Router has the
            default priority of 100 and another Backup Router is added, a
            priority of 50 would be a better choice for it than 99 or 100, in
            order to facilitate faster convergence.

          <name>VRRPv3 Support of VRRPv2</name>
          <t>
            As mentioned above, this support is intended for upgrade scenarios
            and is NOT RECOMMENDED for permanent deployments.
          </t>
          <t>
            An implementation MAY implement a configuration flag that tells it to
            listen for and send both VRRPv2 and VRRPv3 advertisements.
          </t>
          <t>
            When a virtual router is configured this way and is the Active Router, it
            MUST send both types at the configured rate, even if sub-second.
          </t>
          <t>
            When a virtual router is configured this way and is the Backup Router, it
            should time out based on the rate advertised by the Active Router. In the
            case of a VRRPv2 Active Router, this means it must translate the timeout
            value it receives (in seconds) into centiseconds.  Also, a Backup
            Router should ignore VRRPv2 advertisements from the current Active Router
            if it is also receiving VRRPv3 packets from it.  It MAY report when a VRRPv3
            Active Router is not sending VRRPv2 packets as this suggests they don't
            agree on whether they're supporting VRRPv2 interoperation.

              The VRRPv2 Active Router interacting with a sub-second VRRPv3 Backup
              router is the most important example of this.
            </t>
            <t>
              A VRRPv2 implementation should not be given a higher priority than a
              VRRPv2/VRRPv3 implementation it is interoperating with a VRRPv2/VRRPv3 router's
              advertisement rate is sub-second.

            <name>Overwhelming VRRPv2 Backups</name>
            <t>
              It seems possible that a VRRPv3 Active Router sending at centisecond
              rates could potentially overwhelm a VRRPv2 Backup Router with
              potentially non-deterministic results.
            </t>
            <t>
              In this upgrade case, a deployment should initially run the VRRPv3
              Active Routers with lower frequencies, e.g., 100 centiseconds, until
              the VRRPv2 routers are upgraded.  Then, once the deployment has
              verified that VRRPv3 is working properly, the VRRPv2 support
              may be disabled and then the desired sub-second rates may configured.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        VRRP for IPvX does not currently include any type of authentication.
        Earlier versions of the VRRP specification included
        several types of authentication ranging from none to strong.
        Operational experience and further analysis determined that these did
        not provide sufficient security to overcome the vulnerability of
        misconfigured secrets, causing multiple Active Routers to be elected.
        Due to the nature of the VRRP protocol, even if VRRP messages are
        cryptographically protected, it does not prevent hostile nodes from
        behaving as if they are a VRRP Active Routers, creating multiple
        Active Router.  Authentication of VRRP messages could have prevented
        a hostile node from causing all properly functioning routers from going
        into Backup state.  However, having multiple Active Routers can cause
        as much disruption as no routers, which authentication cannot prevent.
        Also, even if a hostile node could not disrupt VRRP, it can disrupt ARP
        and create  the same effect as having all routers go into Backup state.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some L2 switches provide the capability to filter out, for example,
        ARP and/or ND messages from end-hosts on a switch-port basis.  This
        mechanism could also filter VRRP messages from switch ports
        associated with end-hosts and can be considered for deployments with
        untrusted hosts.
      </t>
      <t>
        It should be noted that these attacks are not worse and are a subset
        of the attacks that any node attached to a LAN can do independently
        of VRRP.  The kind of attacks a malicious node on a LAN can perform
        include:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          Promiscuously receiving packets for any router's MAC address.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sending packets with the router's MAC address as the source MAC
          address in the L2 header to tell the L2 switches to send packets
          addressed to the router to the malicious node instead of the router.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sending redirects to tell the hosts to send their traffic
          somewhere else.
</li>
<li>
  Sending unsolicited ND replies.
</li>
<li>
  Answering ND requests, etc.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
  All of these can be done independently of implementing VRRP.
  VRRP does not add to these vulnerabilities.
</t>
<t>
  VRRP includes a mechanism
  (setting TTL = 255, checking on receipt) that protects against VRRP
  packets being injected from another remote network.  This limits most
  vulnerabilities to attacks on the local network.
</t>
<t>
  VRRP does not provide any confidentiality.  Confidentiality is not
  necessary for the correct operation of VRRP, and there is no
  information in the VRRP messages that must be kept secret from other
  nodes on the LAN.
</t>
<t>
  In the context of IPv6 operation, if SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
  is deployed, VRRP is compatible with the "trust anchor" and "trust
  anchor or CGA" modes of SEND <xref target="RFC3971"/>.  The SEND
  configuration needs to give the Active and Backup Routers the same prefix
  delegation in the certificates so that Active and Backup Routers advertise
  the same set of subnet prefixes.  However, the Active and Backup Routers
  should have their own key pairs to avoid private key sharing.
